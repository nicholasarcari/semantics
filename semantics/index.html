<h1>False Pocket Band Website</h1>

<p>Hello hello,</p>

        <p>This is website dedicated to the variety of content associated with the band False Pocket. As a fairly new band, the group has had no home to store any of its material.</p> 

<p>Material includes:
A biography of the band
Contact information
Photos
Videos
Studio recordings
Links to music
Merchandise
Upcoming shows</p>

        <p>The design of the website will have a simple look, emulating the style and attitude of the members of the band and its music.</p>

        <p>With the addition of a website, False Pocket will be able to market themselves in a fashion designed for easy public access. The assumption is that this will help spread the word that False Pocket is a serious group, committed to their music, and dedicated to their fans.</p>
